              Hey! My name is <b>Jake. &nbsp; ðŸ‘‹</b>
              <br />
              <br />I love software. In particular, I'm fascinated with the
              development behind
              <b> game engines, graphics, and games</b>. I'm both personally and
              professionally motivated to navigate the blurs that exist between
              programming, art, and culture. I love empowering creative
              workflows as much as I love understanding what makes things work.
              <br />
              <br />
              Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at BCIT finishing a{" "}
              {bcitProgramLink} with an expected graduation date of
              <b> April 2023</b>. At the moment, I'm currently on the lookout
              for internship and (potentially!) full-time opportunities starting{" "}
              <b> May 2023</b>.
              <br />
              <br />
              While I finish my degree I'm studying engines, learning about
              graphics, making games, and volunteering as a Director at{" "}
              {ubceaLink}!
